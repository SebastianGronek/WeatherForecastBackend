# Weather Forecast Backend Api

Simple weather api created as a recruitment task. 
It enables user to fetch current weather data for chosen city from two external APIs: 
OpenWeatherMap and WeatherBit. OpenWeatherMap provides data for more then 200 000 cities, while WeatherBit for over 40 000. The sole GET endpoint takes three String parameters: 
city name (mandatory), external api name (not required) and units (not required). When no 
external api name is provided (WEATHER_BIT and OPEN_WEATHER_MAP are the options, underscores are necessary), the endpoint will return data from both APIs. If units 
parameter is not included, metric units are used (set as a default). Another possible options are SCIENTIFIC and IMPERIAL units.

### Technologies
* Java SE 11
* Spring Boot Web
* Spring Boot Devtools
* JUnit
* AssertJ
* Lombok

### Setup
Download code to your IDE and run main method in WeatherForecastBackendApplication class:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(WeatherForecastBackendApplication.class, args);
	}
```
The API launches on localhost:8080. Then you can call endpoint *getForecastFromChosenProviders()* with three parameters:
```
 public List<Forecast> getForecastFromChosenProviders(@RequestParam(name = "city") String city, 
                                                      @RequestParam(name = "api", required = false) String chosenApi, 
                                                      @RequestParam(name = "units", required = false) String units)
```
### Response
*getForecastFromChosenProviders()* endpoint returns list of Forecast objects. Each Forecast object contains fields describing various **weather conditions**:

String[] description - short description of most distinct feature of weather;

double pressure -  atmospheric pressure (hPa as default);;

double windSpeed - wind speed (m/s as default);

int windDirection - wind direction in degrees;

double temperature - temperature (Celsius degrees as default);

double apparentTemperature - feel-like temperature, taking humidity and wind into consideration (Celsius degrees as default);

int clouds - cloud cover in %;

double humidity - relative humidity in %;

double precipitation - amount of precipitation, measured for 1h (in millimeters as default);

double snow - amount of snow, measured for 1h (in millimeters as default);

**Each Forecast contains also additional information:**

String provider - name of API, from which date were fetched;

LocalDateTime lastObservationTime - time of observation (in your local timezone, not the place of observation);

String cityName - name of the city for which the forecast was done;

### Examples
Sending a GET request to locally launched API with parameters:

city: Warsaw;

external api: OPEN_WEATHER_MAP

units: IMPERIAL
```
http://localhost:8080/getForecast?city=Warsaw&api=Open_weather_MAP&units=imperial
```
Response:
